Some notes:
In  order to run the search function on the localhost, one must run the command in the terminal -
    
    rake sunspot:solr:start
             
Data is also aleeady seeded. This can be redone with
 
    rake db:seed
 
 The site is hosted on harvest-farmermarket.herokuapp.com
 The search function is not accessible through there as deploying the solr gem on heroku costs fifteen dollars a month
