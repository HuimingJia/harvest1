## [](#header-2)User Experience

The direction of our styling can be described as min-
imalistic, green, and responsive. Our goal started off
to create an e-commerce site that had a somewhat
’farm-y’ feel. That aspect translated to our overall color
scheme. We followed many other e-commerce sites in
picking our design. Sites like Etsy, Amazon, and Yelp
were all analyzed to design the views for our search
results and profiles and the initial splash screen of the
home page.

Our user experience design was guided by the prin-
ciple of being able to reach all functionalities in under
5 clicks. Most can be done in 2-3 clicks from the home
page. We emphasized interactivity with the website
through lots of Ajax. We looked for the site to have
a similar layout through each page so that moving
around the site feels intuitive.


## [](#header-3)Styling Challenges

Bootstrap offered many problems for us at times. Some
elements are forced into their positions using branches
or spaces. This causes problems for different screen
sizes or if browsing with mobile. Another issue has
been text alignment. Due to our CSS formatting, all
alignment is justified making static text fields hard to
design as they must appear fluid.

Gradients have caused issues as, for some reason,
the plug-in we use only allows for 25%/75%. Finally,
the splash screen for our site has gone through sev-
eral redesigns. We have increased the height, changed
pictures, implemented a rotating group of pictures, low-
ered the search bar, and added a customer testimonial.
