## [](#header-2)Product Overview

  Harvest is a customer engagement platform for local
farmers markets and their customers. Harvest makes
it easy for users to learn about farmers markets, the
vendors themselves, and their products. It is meant to
provide users with a convenient way to interact with a
world of fresh fruit and vegetables. Whether you are
new to the farmers market scene or an experienced vet-
eran, our app will have something for you to enhance
your farmers market experience. You can make sure
your local vendors will have their usual goods or you
can do research on a completely new farmers market.
Planning your trip becomes easy with our application.

  All of the information you could want is coherently
laid out for you. With less than 5 clicks you can find
the location and hours of operation of a farmers mar-
ket along with the vendors and products that will be
present. You will never show up to a farmers market
and be disappointed to find that the product you are
looking for is not there. Finding new products to enjoy
and organizing which ones to buy will be a breeze.
Harvest takes any stress out of the farmers market
experience.
